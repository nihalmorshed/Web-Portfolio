                <p>
                    Currently I am working as a Junior Flutter Developer in a startup company named "Niharon Technologies" founded by one of my fellow classmates. I have been working on few mobile applications here in Niharon, some of these projects are still a work in progress. At the moment, I am mostly working on the front-end part of these projects. I am using Flutter for developing the app. I am also learning how to integrate Firebase, REST API's & other technologies for storing, processing & accessing data & images. <br>
                    I have worked on multiple projects & created Mobile Applications with Flutter & really enjoy working with
                    it. It's really a powerful tool for developing mobile apps. I am a self-taught developer & still have
                    a lot to learn. Now I'm curious to learn more about Web Development.
